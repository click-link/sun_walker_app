# sun_walker

Parker Solar Probe is the first human-made spacecraft to reach the corona surface of the sun. As it made it possible to cover a distance of 150M km & facing 2500 degrees F, that is why it is one of the most extraordinary symbols of science, engineering & heliophysics. The young generation must know about the significance of it. That’s why we made an app “Sun Walker” from which they will get all the information and data related to the Parker solar probe in a very well-organized and creative way. We made our app user-friendly & keep it updated by using NASA API. Our app is able to run on 3 platforms - Android, Web and IOS. We are hoping that our project will impact 1.2 billion young people around the world.
